  <h1>The Ancient Aztec God</h1>
  <h2>Xolotl's sacrafice</h2>
  <h3>HEADLINE</h3>
  <p> It is believed in <em>mexican mythology</em> that the axolotl used to be a <b>god</b>. He's said to have turned himself into a type of salamander to avoid a self sacrafice. He and the other gods that created the fifth sun agreeed that there needed to be a self sacrafice in order to nourish the sun, that was stagnant in it's position  in the sky.</p>
  <blockquote>The myth surrounding the unique Mexican axolotl involves Xolotl, an Aztec god determined to escape his
    impending sacrifice.</blockquote>
